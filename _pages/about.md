Welcome to my webpage. 

<img src="/images/favicon.ico" alt="drawing" width="20"/> I am a PhD student in Economics at the University of Michigan (Ann Arbor). I am on the job market for the 2025-26 academic year.

<img src="/images/favicon.ico" alt="drawing" width="20"/> I am a Rackham Graduate School Predoctoral [Fellow](https://rackham.umich.edu/predoctoral-fellowship-celebration/social-sciences/#David-Van-Dijcke) at the University of Michigan in 2024-25. I am also an Academic Visitor at the [Bank of England](https://www.bankofengland.co.uk/).

<img src="/images/favicon.ico" alt="drawing" width="20"/>  My [research](https://davidvandijcke.com/research) develops novel econometric methods combining causal inference with functional data analysis and optimal transport to study settings where the outcomes and/or covariates are functional and high-dimensional. I have implemented these methods to study questions ranging from evaluating labor market policies to understanding mobility patterns in response to crises.

<sup></sup>To make sure I was well-prepared for a career in economics, I got a BA in theatre. You can find the evidence [here](https://davidvandijcke.github.io/performing-arts). <sup></sup>
