6/1/20,The Cost of Staying Open: Voluntary Social Distancing and Lockdowns in the US,"Economics Series Working Papers 910, University of Oxford, Department of Economics","In combating the spread of COVID-19, some governments have been reluctant to adopt lockdown policies due to their perceived economic costs. Such costs can, however, arise even in the absence of restrictive policies, if individuals' independent reaction to the virus slows down the economy. This paper finds that imposing lockdowns leads to lower overall costs to the economy than staying open. We combine detailed location trace data from 40 million mobile devices with difference-in-differences estimations and a modification of the epidemiological SIR model that allows for societal and political response to the virus. In that way, we show that voluntary reaction incurs substantial economic costs, while the additional economic costs arising from lockdown policies are small compared to their large benefits in terms of reduced medical costs. Our results hold for practically all realistic estimates of lockdown efficiency and voluntary response strength. We quantify the counterfactual costs of voluntary social distancing for various US states that implemented lockdowns. For the US as a whole, we estimate that lockdowns reduce the costs of the pandemic by 1.7% of annual GDP per capita, compared to purely voluntary responses.","Brzezinski, Adam, Kecht, Valentin, and Van Dijcke, David (2020).

6/7/20,Using Mobile Device Traces to Improve Near-Real Time Data Collection During the George Floyd Protests,SSRN,"This research note presents a method for using mobile device trace data to improve collection of data on spontaneously erupting protest activity and related events. Based on this method, it presents a highly granular dataset of such activity for the George Floyd Protests in the United States. We use anonymous aggregated mobile device trace data to identify device surges: anomalous changes in the number of devices in a small geographic area, consistent with the assembly of a large number of individuals. Preliminary estimates from ongoing data collection of protest sites and scale are presented. Establishing better measures of where and when protests occur across and within cities improves researchers' understanding of the downstream political and social consequences of mobilization.","Van Dijcke, David and Wright, Austin L.

1/31/21,"Isolation and Insurrection: How Partisanship and Political Geography Fueled January 6, 2021",CEPR Discussion Paper 18209,"We develop a novel approach for estimating spatially dispersed community-level participation in mass protest. This methodology is used to investigate factors associated with participation in the March to Save America event in Washington, D.C. on January 6, 2021. This study combines granular location data from more than 40 million mobile devices with novel measures of community-level voting patterns, the location of organized hate groups, and the entire georeferenced digital archive of the social media platform Parler. We find evidence that partisanship, socio-political isolation, proximity to chapters of the Proud Boys organization, and the local activity on Parler are robustly associated with protest participation. Our research fills a prominent gap in the study of collective action: identifying and studying communities involved in mass-scale events that escalate into violent insurrection.","Sonin, K., & Van Dijcke, D., & Wright, A.

9/1/20,Work Effort and the Cycle: Evidence from Survey Data.,Deutsche Bundesbank Discussion Paper (Forthcoming),"We use data from the World Values Survey and the Work Orientations Survey to analyse the cyclical nature of work effort and attitudes to work effort. Our aim is to test two competing theories of labor effort, the labor hoarding view and the Shapiro and Stiglitz (1984) shirking model. Self-reported work effort is found to be strongly procyclical, while attitudes to effort move slightly countercyclically. We provide evidence for the presence of labor hoarding by showing how the cyclicality of effort changes with the strictness of employment protection legislation. Finally, we document heterogeneity in effort cyclicality across occupations and individuals.","Lewis, V., & Van Dijcke, D. (2019). Work effort and the cycle: Evidence from survey data.

2/17/23,On the Non-Identification of Revenue Production Functions,Bank of England Staff Working Paper No 1015,"Production functions are potentially misspecified when revenue is used as a proxy for output. I formalize and strengthen this common knowledge by showing that neither the production function nor
Hicks-neutral productivity can be identified with such a revenue proxy. This result holds under the standard assumptions used in the literature for a large class of production functions, including all commonly used parametric forms. Among the prevalent approaches to address this issue, only those that impose assumptions on the underlying demand system can possibly identify the production function.","Van Dijcke, D.

10/1/23,Free Discontinuity Regression: With an Application to the Economic Effects of Internet Shutdowns,arXiv,"Discontinuities in regression functions can reveal important insights. In many contexts, like geographic settings, such discontinuities are multivariate and unknown a
priori. We propose a non-parametric regression method that estimates the location
and size of discontinuities by segmenting the regression surface. This estimator is
based on a convex relaxation of the Mumford-Shah functional, for which we establish
identification and convergence. We use it to show that an internet shutdown in India
resulted in a reduction of economic activity by 25–35%, greatly surpassing previous estimates and shedding new light on the true cost of such shutdowns for digital economies
globally.","Gunsilius, F. & Van Dijcke, D. (2023). Free Discontinuity Design: With an Application to the Economic Effects of Internet Shutdowns. Manuscript.",fdd,https://arxiv.org/abs/2309.14630,.,,[Replication materials](https://github.com/Davidvandijcke/fdr),Florian Gunsilius,Econometrics
1/24/25,Return to Office and the Tenure Distribution,Revision requested: The Review of Economics and Statistics,"With the end of the COVID-19 pandemic, debates over return-to-office mandates have intensified, though their economic implications are not fully understood. Using 260 million resumes matched to company data, we analyze the impact of these policies on employee tenure and seniority at three large U.S. tech companies: Microsoft, SpaceX, and Apple. Employing a distributional synthetic controls framework, for which we establish the validity of bootstrapped uniform confidence intervals, we estimate a reduction in tenure and seniority at firms returning to the office. Our findings suggest return-to-office mandates may drive senior employees to competitors, posing a risk to firm productivity and innovation.","Van Dijcke, David, Florian Gunsilius, and Austin L.

1/13/25,disco: Distributional Synthetic Controls,arXiv,"The method of synthetic controls is widely used for evaluating causal effects of policy changes in settings with observational data. Often, researchers aim to estimate the causal impact of policy interventions on a treated unit at an aggregate level while also possessing data at a finer granularity. In this article, we introduce the new disco command, which implements the Distributional Synthetic Controls method introduced in Gunsilius (2023). This command allows researchers to construct entire synthetic distributions for the treated unit based on an optimally weighted average of the distributions of the control units. Several aggregation schemes are provided to facilitate clear reporting of the distributional effects of the treatment. The package offers both quantile-based and CDF-based approaches, comprehensive inference procedures via bootstrap and permutation methods, and visualization capabilities. We empirically illustrate the use of the package by replicating the results in Van Dijcke et al. (2024).",,disco,https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.07550,.,,[Replication materials](https://github.com/Davidvandijcke/disco_stata_journal),Florian Gunsilius,Econometrics
4/5/25,Regression Discontinuity Design with Distribution-Valued Outcomes,arXiv,"This article introduces Regression Discontinuity Design (RDD) with Distribution-Valued Outcomes (R3D), extending the standard RDD framework to settings where the outcome is a distribution rather than a scalar. Such settings arise when treatment is assigned at a higher level of aggregation than the outcome-for example, when a subsidy is allocated based on a firm-level revenue cutoff while the outcome of interest is the distribution of employee wages within the firm. Since standard RDD methods cannot accommodate such two-level randomness, I propose a novel approach based on random distributions. The target estimand is a ""local average quantile treatment effect"", which averages across random quantiles. To estimate this target, I introduce two related approaches: one that extends local polynomial regression to random quantiles and another based on local Fréchet regression, a form of functional regression. For both estimators, I establish asymptotic normality and develop uniform, debiased confidence bands together with a data-driven bandwidth selection procedure. Simulations validate these theoretical properties and show existing methods to be biased and inconsistent in this setting. I then apply the proposed methods to study the effects of gubernatorial party control on within-state income distributions in the US, using a close-election design. The results suggest a classic equality-efficiency tradeoff under Democratic governorship, driven by reductions in income at the top of the distribution.","Van Dijcke, D. (2025).
