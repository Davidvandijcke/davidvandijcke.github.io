6/1/20,The Cost of Staying Open: Voluntary Social Distancing and Lockdowns in the US,"Economics Series Working Papers 910, University of Oxford, Department of Economics","In combating the spread of COVID-19, some governments have been reluctant to adopt lockdown policies due to their perceived economic costs. Such costs can, however, arise even in the absence of restrictive policies, if individuals' independent reaction to the virus slows down the economy. This paper finds that imposing lockdowns leads to lower overall costs to the economy than staying open. We combine detailed location trace data from 40 million mobile devices with difference-in-differences estimations and a modification of the epidemiological SIR model that allows for societal and political response to the virus. In that way, we show that voluntary reaction incurs substantial economic costs, while the additional economic costs arising from lockdown policies are small compared to their large benefits in terms of reduced medical costs. Our results hold for practically all realistic estimates of lockdown efficiency and voluntary response strength. We quantify the counterfactual costs of voluntary social distancing for various US states that implemented lockdowns. For the US as a whole, we estimate that lockdowns reduce the costs of the pandemic by 1.7% of annual GDP per capita, compared to purely voluntary responses.","Brzezinski, Adam, Kecht, Valentin, and Van Dijcke, David (2020).

6/7/20,Using Mobile Device Traces to Improve Near-Real Time Data Collection During the George Floyd Protests,SSRN,"This research note presents a method for using mobile device trace data to improve collection of data on spontaneously erupting protest activity and related events. Based on this method, it presents a highly granular dataset of such activity for the George Floyd Protests in the United States. We use anonymous aggregated mobile device trace data to identify device surges: anomalous changes in the number of devices in a small geographic area, consistent with the assembly of a large number of individuals. Preliminary estimates from ongoing data collection of protest sites and scale are presented. Establishing better measures of where and when protests occur across and within cities improves researchers' understanding of the downstream political and social consequences of mobilization.","Van Dijcke, David and Wright, Austin L.

1/31/21,"Isolation and Insurrection: How Partisanship and Political Geography Fueled January 6, 2021",CEPR Discussion Paper 18209,"We develop a novel approach for estimating spatially dispersed community-level participation in mass protest. This methodology is used to investigate factors associated with participation in the March to Save America event in Washington, D.C. on January 6, 2021. This study combines granular location data from more than 40 million mobile devices with novel measures of community-level voting patterns, the location of organized hate groups, and the entire georeferenced digital archive of the social media platform Parler. We find evidence that partisanship, socio-political isolation, proximity to chapters of the Proud Boys organization, and the local activity on Parler are robustly associated with protest participation. Our research fills a prominent gap in the study of collective action: identifying and studying communities involved in mass-scale events that escalate into violent insurrection.","Sonin, K., & Van Dijcke, D., & Wright, A.

9/1/20,Work Effort and the Cycle: Evidence from Survey Data.,Deutsche Bundesbank Discussion Paper (Forthcoming),"We use data from the World Values Survey and the Work Orientations Survey to analyse the cyclical nature of work effort and attitudes to work effort. Our aim is to test two competing theories of labor effort, the labor hoarding view and the Shapiro and Stiglitz (1984) shirking model. Self-reported work effort is found to be strongly procyclical, while attitudes to effort move slightly countercyclically. We provide evidence for the presence of labor hoarding by showing how the cyclicality of effort changes with the strictness of employment protection legislation. Finally, we document heterogeneity in effort cyclicality across occupations and individuals.","Lewis, V., & Van Dijcke, D. (2019). Work effort and the cycle: Evidence from survey data.

2/17/23,On the Non-Identification of Revenue Production Functions,Bank of England Staff Working Paper No 1015,"Production functions are potentially misspecified when revenue is used as a proxy for output. I formalize and strengthen this common knowledge by showing that neither the production function nor
Hicks-neutral productivity can be identified with such a revenue proxy. This result holds under the standard assumptions used in the literature for a large class of production functions, including all commonly used parametric forms. Among the prevalent approaches to address this issue, only those that impose assumptions on the underlying demand system can possibly identify the production function.","Van Dijcke, D.

10/1/23,Free Discontinuity Regression: With an Application to the Economic Effects of Internet Shutdowns,arXiv,"Discontinuities in regression functions can reveal important insights. In many contexts, like geographic settings, such discontinuities are multivariate and unknown a
priori. We propose a non-parametric regression method that estimates the location
and size of discontinuities by segmenting the regression surface. This estimator is
based on a convex relaxation of the Mumford-Shah functional, for which we establish
identification and convergence. We use it to show that an internet shutdown in India
resulted in a reduction of economic activity by 25Ð35%, greatly surpassing previous estimates and shedding new light on the true cost of such shutdowns for digital economies
globally.","Gunsilius, F. & Van Dijcke, D. (2023). Free Discontinuity Design: With an Application to the Economic Effects of Internet Shutdowns. Manuscript.",fdd,https://arxiv.org/abs/2309.14630,.,,https://github.com/Davidvandijcke/fdr,Florian Gunsilius
