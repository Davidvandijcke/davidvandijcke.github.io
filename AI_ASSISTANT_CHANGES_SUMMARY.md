# AI Assistant Updates Summary

## Changes Made

### 1. Fixed AI Assistant Button (Main Website)
**File:** `_includes/footer/ai-assistant.html`
- Fixed the floating button click issue by applying animation to button only, not container
- Added robust JavaScript with error handling and retry logic
- Added touch support for mobile devices
- Added console logging for debugging
- Ensured button remains clickable with `pointer-events: all`
- Button pauses animation when clicked for smooth transition

### 2. Enhanced AI Assistant with Coauthor Verification (Submodule)
**File:** `david-research-assistant/app.py`

#### Key Features Added:
1. **Dynamic Paper Loading**
   - Automatically loads papers from `_publications` and `_wps` directories
   - Parses YAML front matter to extract paper metadata
   - No manual updates needed when new papers are published

2. **Three-Layer Verification System**
   - **Layer 1**: Prompt engineering with strong coauthor instructions
   - **Layer 2**: Pattern-based verification to correct missing coauthors
   - **Layer 3**: Judge agent that fact-checks responses

3. **Updated to Gemini 2.5 Flash**
   - Both main agent and judge now use Gemini 2.5 Flash
   - Fallback to 2.0 Flash, then 1.5 Flash if needed

4. **Added PyYAML Dependency**
   - Updated `requirements.txt` to include `pyyaml==6.0.1`

### 3. Documentation Added
- `COAUTHOR_VERIFICATION_README.md` - Explains the coauthor verification system
- `JUDGE_SYSTEM_README.md` - Details the judge agent and dynamic loading
- `app_backup.py` - Backup of original app.py

## How It Works

### Button Functionality
1. The floating button animation now only affects the button itself, not the click area
2. Click handlers use direct `onclick` assignment for reliability
3. Animation pauses during transitions to prevent issues
4. Multiple initialization strategies ensure the button always works

### AI Assistant Intelligence
1. When someone asks about papers, the system:
   - Generates an initial response with Gemini 2.5 Flash
   - Verifies all coauthors are mentioned correctly
   - Passes through judge agent for final fact-checking
   - Returns only verified, accurate information

2. Papers are loaded dynamically from markdown files:
   - No code changes needed when publishing new papers
   - Automatically extracts coauthors from the `coauthors` field
   - Maintains proper academic attribution standards

## Testing the Changes

### Test the Button
1. Open the website and look for the floating button (bottom right)
2. Click it - should open the chat interface
3. Click the X to close - button should reappear
4. Check browser console for debug messages

### Test the AI Assistant
1. Ask about papers with multiple authors:
   - "Tell me about the Free Discontinuity Regression paper"
   - "Who wrote the Return to Office paper?"
   - "What papers has David written with Florian Gunsilius?"

2. The assistant should always mention ALL coauthors correctly

## Next Steps

To deploy these changes:
1. Commit changes in the main repository
2. Commit changes in the david-research-assistant submodule
3. Push both to GitHub
4. The Hugging Face space will automatically update
